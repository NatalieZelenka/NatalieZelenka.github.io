## My work

Since 2018, I've been a Research Data Scientist at [The Jean Golding Institute](http://bristol.ac.uk/golding/) where I work to support researchers across the University of Bristol and our partners, and the wider city of Bristol, to use data science and statistics to solve their research problems.

<!-- TODO: Add links to projects - and link to general project page -->
<!-- TODO: rewrite-->

To support this goal, I:
- **Create and maintain partnerships** with researchers, research organisations and civic groups to develop plans for collaborative data science research and events. 
- **Carry out and support Research Software Engineering, Statistics, and Data Science tasks** such as Structural Equation Modelling or Multi-level modelling, building a command line tool that performs linear optimisation and automatically builds reports, or Natural Language Processing analysis of political speeches. I currently have 7+ years of experienced developing in Python, and make daily use of software engineering best practices such as Version Control (Git), testing, Continuous Integration, and GitHub for collaboration/project-management. I also have 3 years of experience in using R for data analysis.
- **Build tools and carry out research to support the data science community** such as building a Python package for multiverse analysis, [building and researching materials to help data scientists consider ethics in their work (Data Hazards)](http://datahazards.com), contributing to research about Data Visualisation, or synthesising and scraping data for downstream analysis.
- **Develop competency in data science around the University at all career levels** through creating, carrying out or supporting training, supervising internships and student projects, and answering the [Ask-JGI data science queries inbox](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/ask-jgi/).
-  **Build communities around data science** by organising and facilitating regular activities like [Data Ethics Club](https://dataethicsclub.com/) and [The Data Visualisation Interest Group](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/get-involved/data-visualisation-interest-group/), and one-offs like [The Bristol-Turing Data Study Group](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/partner-with-us/the-alan-turing-institute/bristol-data-study-group/), [Open Bristol hack-a-thons](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/events/2018/bristol-data-jam--hackathon.html), or [the eLife Innovation sprint](https://sprint.elifesciences.org/projects2021/)
