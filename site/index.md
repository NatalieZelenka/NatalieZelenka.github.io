## My work

Since 2018, I've been a Research Data Scientist at [The Jean Golding Institute](http://bristol.ac.uk/golding/) where I work to support researchers across the University of Bristol and our partners, and the wider city of Bristol, to use data science and statistics to solve their research problems.

<!-- TODO: Add links to projects - and link to general project page -->

To support this goal, I:
- **Create and maintain partnerships** with researchers, research organisations and civic groups to develop plans for collaborative data science research and events. 
- **Carry out and support Research Software Engineering, Statistics, and Data Science tasks** such as [Structural Equation Modelling]() or [Multi-level modelling](), building a command line tool that performs linear optimisation and automatically builds reports, or supervising an intern to do [Natural Language Processing analysis of political speeches](). I currently have 7+ years of experienced developing in Python, and make frequent use of software engineering best practices such as Version Control (Git), testing, Continuous Integration, and GitHub for collaboration/project-management. I'm always looking to improve! I also have 3 years of experience in using R for data analysis.
- **Build tools and carry out research to support the data science community** such as [building a Python package for multiverse analysis](), [building and researching materials to help data scientists consider ethics in their work (Data Hazards)](), and [contributing to research about Data Visualisation]().
- **Develop competency in data science around the University at all career levels** through [creating, carrying out or supporting training](), supervising internships and student projects, and answering the [Ask-JGI data science queries inbox]().
-  **Build communities around data science** by organising and facilitating regular activities like [Data Ethics Club]() and [The Data Visualisation Interest Group](), and one-offs like [The Bristol-Turing Data Study Group](), [Open Bristol hack-a-thons](), or [the eLife Innovation sprint]()

### Research Interests
<!-- TODO: Add links -->

I'm an interdisciplinary researcher with broad research interests across [Computational Biology](), [Improving Research](), and [Applied Mathematics and Statistics]().
