<h3>Non-Science Interests</h3>

I play the cajon and ukulele in a pirate-punk sea shanty band, attempt to build video games in impossibly short time-frames during game jams like [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/), and occasionally [draw things](https://twitter.com/NatZelenka/status/1481289270786678789).
